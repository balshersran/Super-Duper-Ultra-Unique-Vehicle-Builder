  ## Description 
  This project is a CLI vehicle builder. It has a couple of basic functionalities such as, start, turn off, turn left, turn right, tow, wheelie.  User can  either create a new vehicle and have a new vin assigned to their new vehicle or choose from a list of vehicles provided. Vehicles include Truck/Motorbike/Car object classes. Initially this project was to portray my abilities of have class objects and then have the ability to assign those prebuilt object properties to new vehicles. The inteded purpose of this project was to advance my understanding of the concept of having class objects, parent classes, children classes and the ability to create new variable with the prebuilt blueprints already set. Learning how to import select files and how to implement interfaces alongside extending class objects with parent class objects.
